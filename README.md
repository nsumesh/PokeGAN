A Group Project where we Built a Generative Adversarial network trained a dataset of 14,000 images of Pok√©mon
Implemented a training process that involves alternating steps between the discriminator and generator with the discriminator classifying it, accordingly, resulting in refinement of image generation capabilities which would accordingly generate a set of Pokemon based on the various images in the dataset
